## What?
It is an index made up of several “vital” scores/KPIs. It gives you an overall idea of how healthy a customer’s relationship is with your product. It also 
enables you to predict how your relationship with a given customer may change in the future like <strong>renewing</strong> or <strong>churning</strong> subscriptions.</br>

## Why?
Some common objectives of implementing a Customer Health Score are to:
* Provide a data-driven definition of how healthy a customer is, rather than relying on gut feel and personal opinions.
* Enable proactive intervention long before a customer is at risk of churning.
* Identify advocates who can influence prospects to become customers.
* Detect highly engaged and loyal clients, who would make excellent advocates.

## How?
In this section, I will describe the **features** I have considered as key measures and the **method** used to calculate the Customer Health.

### Selected Features
The following are the four features selected among the 6 tabs in the given excel file and considered as the most relevant ones for the calculation of the CHS.

#### Product Usage 
Is how often the users of ContentSquare are connecting to the applcation and how much time they are spending on it.

#### Net Promoter Score
Is a customer loyalty and satisfaction measurement taken from asking customers how likely they are to recommend your product or service to others.</br>
Depending on the score given to the Net Promoter question, three categories of people can be distinguished:
* Promoters = respondents giving a 9 or 10 score
* Passives = respondents giving a 7 or 8 score
* Detractors = respondents giving a 0 to 6 score

#### Satisfaction
Is how much users are satisfied with the support team.
#### Certification 
Is how much users are certified and recognized as potential power users.

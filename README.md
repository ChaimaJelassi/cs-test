## What?
It is an index made up of several “vital” scores/KPIs. It gives you an overall idea of how healthy a customer’s relationship is with your product. It also 
enables you to predict how your relationship with a given customer may change in the future like <strong>renewing</strong> or <strong>churning</strong> subscriptions.</br>

## Why?
Some common objectives of implementing a Customer Health Score are to:
* Provide a data-driven definition of how healthy a customer is, rather than relying on gut feel and personal opinions.
* Enable proactive intervention long before a customer is at risk of churning.
* Identify advocates who can influence prospects to become customers.
* Detect highly engaged and loyal clients, who would make excellent advocates.

In this section, I will describe the **features** I have considered as key measures and the **method** used to calculate the Customer Health.

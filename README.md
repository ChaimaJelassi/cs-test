# What
It is an index made up of several “vital” scores/KPIs. It gives you an overall idea of how healthy a customer’s relationship is with your product. It also 
enables you to predict how your relationship with a given customer may change in the future like <strong>renewing</strong> or <strong>canceling subscriptions</strong>.
By monitoring Customer Health Scores, you can detect early signals of increased friction or declining customer engagement. You can also identify highly engaged and loyal clients, who would make excellent advocates.

# Why
Some common objectives of implementing a Customer Health Score are to:
Provide a data-driven definition of how healthy a customer is, rather than relying on gut feel and personal opinion
Enable proactive intervention long before a customer is at risk of churning
Identify advocates who can influence prospects to become customers
Determine how different customer segments compare, to identify underlying issues that may be specific to one segment
